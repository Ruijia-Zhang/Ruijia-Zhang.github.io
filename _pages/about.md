# üë©‚Äçüéì About Me
I am currently focusing on **mechanical intelligence in robot manipulation**, as I pursue my Ph.D. degree in Electronic and Computer Engineering at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, supervised by [Prof. Yajing Shen](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/eeyajing).

[A tendon-driven soft hand for dexterous manipulation](https://miaoli.github.io/research/)

**Date**: 08/2023-07/2024

**Role**: Student Researcher, supervised by [Prof. Miao Li(ÊùéÊ∑º)](https://miaoli.github.io/), WHU

**Ruijia Zhang**, Zhenyu Nie, Fuqiang Zhao.

**Description**: 
- We developed¬†an anthropomorphic hand with flexible microstructure fingers capable of achieving controllable stiffness deformation, enabling effective and adaptive object grasping.
- The synergy patterns were incorporated into our mechatronic hand system to replicate coordinated and ordered human hand motions observed during the grasp approach phase.
- We propose a learning-based approach utilizing the finite element method (FEM) to model real-time inverse kinematics(IK) computation on highly nonlinear soft hand.

[Modulating Electronic Properties of Œ≤-Ga2O3 by Strain Engineering](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221137972300709X)

**Date**: 06/2022-07/2023

**Role**: Student Researcher, supervised by [Prof. Wei Shen](https://technology.whu.edu.cn/info/1016/1914.htm), WHU

**Ruijia Zhang**, Min Li, Gai Wu, Lijie Li, Kang Liang, Wei Shen.

**Description**
- I investigated the effect of strain on the bandgap and effective mass tunability of Œ≤-Ga2O3 using the GGA+U method based on density functional theory.
- The indirect-direct bandgap transition and electron mobility anisotropy in Œ≤-Ga2O3 under strain were discovered, suggesting potential applications of strain engineering in modulating its electronic properties.

**Ruijia Zhang**, Wenke Zhou, Zibin Nian, Ning Luo, Xiaoya He.

[**video**](https://youtu.be/oTg_eVXxm2c)

**Description**
-  I designed a double-joint fish robot driven by a coupling propulsion mechanism, with functions including straightening, turning, sinking and floating, and autonomous underwater cruising.
-  Underwater experiments and CFD simulation were established to study the relationship between swimming speed and mechanism design/driving parameters.

[Heat-Powered Vehicle](https://worldwide.espacenet.com/patent/search/family/079806938/publication/CN215513213U?q=CN%20215513213)

**Date**: 09/2020-09/2021

**Role**: Team Leader, supervised by Prof. Xiaosun Wang and Prof. Min Li, WHU

**Ruijia Zhang**, Wenke Zhou, Zibin Nian

[**video**](https://youtu.be/gkrrsqVv6eA)

**Description**
- I designed and produced an integrated thermodynamic vehicle powered by the Stirling engine and completed the closed-loop obstacle avoidance trajectory with a purely mechanical structure. Through fine-tuning mechanisms and CNC machining, the trajectory accuracy is improved by 50%.
- Our team shattered the university record by winning the National Gold Award (1.43%).
- I served as a teaching assistant in a boot camp based on this project, training students in basic engineering skills.

**Date**: 10/2021-11/2022

**Role**: Team Leader, supervised by Prof. Min Li, WHU

**Ruijia Zhang**, Zhihang Wei, Jingrun Cai, Haoming Chen, Xinyitian

[**video**](https://youtu.be/--K_LBozzOY)

**Description**
- I improved a two-way loop procedure of the smart wardrobe based on PLC program control.
- I optimized the intermittent transmission mechanism based on Adams dynamical simulation and SolidWorks Topology to eliminate the flexible impact and achieve the lightweight design of the groove wheels.
